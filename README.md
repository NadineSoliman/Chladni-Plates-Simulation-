CHLADNI PLATES SIMULATION

Background

Ernst Chladni is a German physicist and musician, who heavily contributed to the field of acoustics. His most well-known experiment, however, is the 2D resonance experiment that now holds his name, Chladni’s plates or Chladni’s figures. In his experiment, Chladni excited a metal plate by running a violin bow along the side of the plate, and used sand particles to visualize the standing wave produced. As the metal began to vibrate, it formed standing waves on its surface, which drove the sand particles to form characteristic patterns. By observing the position of the sand particles, Chladni was able to determine the positions of the nodes and anti-nodes on the surface. And, thus this enabled him to visualize the standing waves on the surface of the plate, that would otherwise not be visible to the naked eye. When the plate was driven at different frequencies, different patterns would form. Further, using different materials and different plate shapes, lead to different patterns and different standing waves. Chladni theorized his studies and formulated equations to describe the motion of the vibrating surfaces, and understanding the spread of sound waves within solids.

Goal

This simulation aims to provide a visualization of the experiment, and replicate its results computationally. In this simulation, we will explore the results of the experiment with regards to the square plate, as it provides a wide range of distinct pattern.
